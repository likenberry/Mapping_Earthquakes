# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is create an interactive map showing earthquakes around the globe. The magnitude of the earthquakes are scaled by size of the circle marker and by the color. The legend at the bottom of the screen shows that earthquakes with a larger magnitude are darker in color. Updates were made to the map to include an overlay containing the Earth's tectonic plates and another overlay showing major earthquakes with different colors for highlighting. Finally another map style was added to include a dark version along with the streets and satellite versions. This analysis was accomplished using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Leaflet, the JavaScript, library was used to create the maps along with an API key from Mapbox. These resources were used to create a clear map showing earthquakes all over the world.
